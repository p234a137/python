# Case Closed?
# Finally, we'll want a way to test whether a file we've opened is closed. Sometimes we'll have a lot of file objects open, and if we're not careful, they won't all be closed. How can we test this?
# 
# f = open("bg.txt")
# f.closed
# # False
# f.close()
# f.closed
# # True
# Python file objects have a closed attribute which is True when the file is closed and False otherwise.
# 
# By checking file_object.closed, we'll know whether our file is closed and can call close() on it if it's still open.
# 
# Instructions
# Below your with...as code, do two things:
# 
# Check if the file is not .closed.
# If that's the case, call .close() on it.
# (You don't need an else here, since your if statement should do nothing if .closed is True.)
# After your if statement, print out the value of my_file.closed to make sure your file is really closed.
with open("text.txt", "w") as my_file:
    my_file.write("any data")
    if not my_file.closed:
        my_file.close()

print my_file.closed
